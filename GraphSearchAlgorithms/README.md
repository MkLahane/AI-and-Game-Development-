A project with some of the major search algorithms (Depth  First Search, Breadth First Search, Hill Climb, Beam, A*, Dijkstra's algorithm), with some interactive data creation and visualisation. 
After running the program, left mouse click will let you add nodes and drag the mouse between two nodes to add an edge, between them, and the graph is undirected. 
You can press z, to delete the last node you added.
